### How to identify if a problem can be solved by DP or not?

- Typically, all the problems that require to maximize or minimize certain quantity or counting problems that say to count the arrangements under certain condition or certain probability problems can be solved by using Dynamic Programming.
- Common examples of DP [(GFG Link)] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/#DynamicProgramming):
  - Fibonacii series
  - [LCS (longest common subsequence)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSno9rV8Rhg)
  - [LIS (longest increasing subsequence)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPQY__2H3tE)
  - [Edit Distance] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We3YDTzNXEk)
  - [Min Cost Path] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/min-cost-path-dp-6/)
  - Coin Change Problems
    - [Total unique ways to reach the sum / Is it possible to reach this sum?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4a7cmjZY0)
    - [Minimum number of coins needed to reach the sum] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0ZqKpToTic)
